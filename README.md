This project helps a user with typing on the microsoft word using voice rather than the keyboard.
To start using it you need to have python installed on your pc.
Download the zipped release file on this repository and extract it on your project working space.
Install SpeechRecognition library using "pip install SpeechRecognition".
Open a cmd/terminal and run the voice_typing.py file.
After a few seconds, the ms word application appears and start listening for any voice from you and types it automatically.
Thank you!
